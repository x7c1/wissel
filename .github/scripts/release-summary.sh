# Shared helpers for the hand-written summary region of the release PR body.
#
# The release PR body is split in two by a marker line: everything above it
# is written by a human and is preserved across regeneration, everything
# below it is rebuilt from `git log` on every push to main. The summary
# region is what the Release workflow publishes as the GitHub Release body.
# The layout and the marker are documented in docs/guides/30-release.md; this
# script holds the only definition of the marker string, so no caller
# hardcodes it a second time.
#
# Usage:
#   source release-summary.sh
#   summary=$(summary_region "$body")
#
# Or standalone:
#   bash release-summary.sh marker
#   bash release-summary.sh placeholder
#   bash release-summary.sh region < body.md
#
# Every function here is pure text manipulation — no network, no GitHub CLI
# — so release-summary.test.sh can exercise them offline. The PR lookup that
# needs the GitHub CLI lives in release-pr-lookup.sh instead.

# The single definition of the marker that separates the human region from
# the machine-generated changelog.
changelog_marker() {
    printf '%s\n' '<!-- changelog:auto -->'
}

# The sentinel left in a freshly generated body, marking a summary that has
# not been written yet.
summary_sentinel() {
    printf '%s\n' '<!-- release-summary:todo -->'
}

# The starting point for a summary nobody has written yet.
summary_placeholder() {
    cat <<EOF
## Summary

$(summary_sentinel)

# Echo everything above the first occurrence of the marker, with trailing
# blank lines trimmed. Echo nothing when the marker is absent: such a body
# predates the marker and is wholly machine-generated, so it carries no
# summary to preserve.

# so arbitrary Markdown in the human region (code fences, nested comments,
# horizontal rules) cannot corrupt it.
